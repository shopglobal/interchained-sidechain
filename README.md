## Command-line + Server utilities for handling Ethereum + Binance Smart Chain account(s)
Easy handling of ERC20/BEP20 tokens. For use with tokenized Electronero assets, or for integration Ethereum &amp; Binance Smart Chain into Webnero or Electronero Passport utilities. The module contained in this repository consists of example script(s) and a package.json which contains additional utilities we use for handling ERC20/BEP20 within NodeJS. It could be modified to be used with any project. This repository is the host for the Electronero Project. So feel free to fork your own version, and for any features you would like to share with the community just submit a pull request and it will be merged within reasonable time by one of the maintainers. 

# Requirements
- NodeJS <a href='https://nodejs.org/en/'><img src='https://nodejs.org/static/images/logo.svg' width="5%" height="5%"><a/>, NPM <a href='https://www.npmjs.com/'><img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Npm-logo.svg/1080px-Npm-logo.svg.png' width="5%" height="5%"></a>
- A Web3 connection to ETH and BSC (Need help? See Getting Started with Web3 below)
- Some blockchain knowledge to handle decimal precision and various cryptocurrency integration parameters.

# Installation 
- Make sure NodeJS/NPM are installed.
- Get familiar with NodeJS, Web3 (see below: Getting Started with Webpack), and Webpack.
- Install packages ```npm i``` 

# Getting Started
The 0x* addresses that interchained-web3-0x generates are specifically for use on ETH/BSC blockchains.
Public address, Private keys, and Mnemonic are generated. 

### interchained-web3-0x-cli 
Access interchained-web3-0x utility with command ```node interchained-web3-0x-cli.js```
You'll be prompted to enter the amount of 0x addresses you would like to generate. 

### interchained-web3-0x-server (soon)
Spin up a headless interchained-web3-0x web server node in one-line with command ```node bin/www/interchained-web3-0x-server.js 8080```
...or use package scripts:  ```npm run server```
...or add a flag to interchained-web3-0x-cli  on startup ```--server 8080``` to  interchained-web3-0x
ex. ```node interchained-web3-0x-cli.js --server 8080``` 
Close all headless interchained nodes command: ```npm run disconnect```
Default web server runs on port 8080.

# Getting Started with Web3
web3.js is a javascript library that allows our client-side application to talk to the blockchain. We configure web3 to communicate via Metamask.
Web3 can be obtained through NPM and connection to ETH / BSC blockchain can be established through public/private channels.

Web3 NPM: https://www.npmjs.com/package/web3
Web3 DOCS: https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.2/getting-started.html#adding-web3-js
Installing Web3 is as easy as ````npm i web3 --save````
Then in the app require Web3 ````const Web3 = require('web3');````

## Establish Web3 Connection to ETH blockchain with Infura 
To get started quickly we establish a Web3 connection to ETH network via an Infura API key to use for ERC20 blockchain calls:
https://infura.io/docs/ethereum#section/Make-Requests
https://blog.infura.io/getting-started-with-infuras-ethereum-api/

Since we required Web3 now we can access Web3 in Interchained, and established a connection to ETH blockchain with Infura. 
```
// mainnet ETH
const eth_web3 = new Web3('https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/a60a84ebf4fe4290b094b75d9c383b7f');
// testnet ETH
// const eth_web3 = new Web3('https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/a24f8ja84fea5fb79c3094eb46842d90');
```
Now that ETH is initialized in Interchained, let's prepare to to connect with BSC blockchain.

## Establish Web3 Connection to Binance Smart Chain directly through Binance 
To get started quickly we'll establish a Web3 connection to BSC network to use for BEP20 calls:
https://docs.binance.org/smart-chain/developer/create-wallet.html
https://docs.binance.org/smart-chain/guides/bsc-intro.html

Following along the steps, at this stage we are ready to proceed with BSC. Ok will establish a connection to BSC blockchain directly. 
```
// mainnet BSC
const bsc_web3 = new Web3('https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443');
// testnet BSC
// const bsc_web3 = new Web3('https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.binance.org:8545');
```
