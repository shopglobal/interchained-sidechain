# Interchained | <b>SideChained</b> === <i>(Web3 + (0x + Altcoin) </i> 
Designed, developed, and open-sourced by Shopglobal; Made possible by Electronero Network Project<p>&nbsp;</br>
Interchained, as in interoperable blockchains.</br>
SideChained is a NodeJS based portable, interoperable, "cross-chain" ledger utlility which enables simultaneous or exclusive transaction support for ERC20/BEP20/COINS. Sidechain Web3 Support for 0x (BSC/ETH) && native support for Cryptonote out of the box. SideChained is based on a combination of two main components. SideChained open source package, and Electronero Passport, a Private API on server interacting with wallets. SideChained is portable. Enable cross-chain swaps & simultaneous transactions between ERC20, BEP20, and COINS. Web Server Public/Private API coming soon! Stay tuned!

## Command-line + Server utilities for handling Ethereum + Binance Smart Chain account(s)
Easy handling of ERC20/BEP20 tokens. For use with tokenized Electronero assets, or for integration Ethereum &amp; Binance Smart Chain into Webnero or Electronero Passport utilities. The module contained in this repository consists of example script(s) and a package.json which contains additional utilities we use for handling ERC20/BEP20 within NodeJS. It could be modified to be used with any project. This repository is the host for the Electronero Project. So feel free to fork your own version, and for any features you would like to share with the community just submit a pull request and it will be merged within reasonable time by one of the maintainers. 

# Requirements

- Install packages ```npm i``` 

# Getting Started
The 0x* addresses that interchained-web3-0x generates are specifically for use on ETH/BSC blockchains.
Public address, Private keys, and Mnemonic are generated. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
### interchained-web3-0x-cli 
Access interchained-web3-0x utility with command ```node interchained-web3-0x-cli.js```
You'll be prompted to enter the amount of 0x addresses you would like to generate. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
### interchained-web3-0x-server (soon)
Spin up a headless interchained-web3-0x web server node in one-line with command ```node bin/www/interchained-web3-0x-server.js 8080```
...or use package scripts:  ```npm run server```
...or add a flag to interchained-web3-0x-cli  on startup ```--server 8080``` to  interchained-web3-0x
ex. ```node interchained-web3-0x-cli.js --server 8080``` 
Close all headless interchained nodes command: ```npm run disconnect```
Default web server runs on port 8080.

# Getting Started with Web3 <a href='https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.2/getting-started.html#adding-web3-js'><img src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/infura-blog-content/2021/05/pasted-image-0--40-.png' width="3%" height="3%"><a/>
web3.js is a javascript library that allows our client-side application to talk to the blockchain. We configure Web3 <a href=''><img src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/infura-blog-content/2021/05/pasted-image-0--40-.png' width="3%" height="3%"><a/>to communicate via Infura(ETH), or Binance(BSC).
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
Web3 <a href='https://infura.io/dashboard/ethereum'><img src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/infura-blog-content/2021/05/pasted-image-0--40-.png' width="3%" height="3%"><a/> can be obtained through NPM, and connections to ETH / BSC blockchain can be established through public/private channels.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Installing Web3 is as easy as ```npm i web3 --save```
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
Then in the app require Web3 ```const Web3 = require('web3');```
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Establish Web3 <a href='https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.2/getting-started.html#adding-web3-js'><img src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/infura-blog-content/2021/05/pasted-image-0--40-.png' width="3%" height="3%"><a/> Connection to ETH blockchain with Infura <a href='https://infura.io/dashboard/ethereum'><img src='https://i.ibb.co/kB3LMss/infura.png' width="3%" height="3%"><a/>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
To get started quickly we establish a Web3 connection to ETH network via an Infura <a href='https://infura.io/dashboard/ethereum'><img src='https://i.ibb.co/kB3LMss/infura.png' width="3%" height="3%"><a/> API key to use for ERC20 blockchain calls:
https://infura.io/docs/ethereum#section/Make-Requests
https://blog.infura.io/getting-started-with-infuras-ethereum-api/
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Since we required Web3 now we can access Web3 in Interchained, and established a connection to ETH blockchain with Infura. 
 `Remember to personalize mainnet/testnet Infura API keys. Replace "MAINNET_INFURA_API_KEY" or TESTNET_INFURA_API_KEY"'
```
// mainnet ETH
const eth_web3 = new Web3('https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/MAINNET_INFURA_API_KEY');
// testnet ETH
const eth_web3 = new Web3('https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/TESTNET_INFURA_API_KEY');
```
Now that ETH is initialized in Interchained, let's prepare to to connect with BSC blockchain.

## Establish Web3 Connection to Binance Smart Chain directly through Binance 
To get started quickly we'll establish a Web3 connection to BSC network to use for BEP20 calls:
https://docs.binance.org/smart-chain/developer/create-wallet.html
https://docs.binance.org/smart-chain/guides/bsc-intro.html
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Following along the steps, at this stage we are ready to proceed with BSC. Ok will establish a connection to BSC blockchain directly. 
```
// mainnet BSC
const bsc_web3 = new Web3('https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443');
// testnet BSC
const bsc_web3 = new Web3('https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.binance.org:8545');
```
